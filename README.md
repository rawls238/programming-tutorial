## Programming Tutorial ##

This repository includes materials that are to be utilized for the programming tutorial on 3/5/2018. As well, it will serve as a general bank of resources to help you get started with programming in the context of working on the paper for your research seminar.

## Instructions for Tutorial ##

1) Getting started with R. Go to the [main R website](https://www.r-project.org/) to download R. For this tutorial I also recommend that you download (the free version of) [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) for writing and executing code in R. 

2) Please install the following R packages: "ggplot2", "dplyr". Do this by opening up RStudio and typing in ```install.packages("ggplot2")``` and then ```install.packages("dplyr")```. 


Please let me know if you have any issues with this.




3) ```tutorial.R``` contains the exercise that you will attempt during the tutorial and ```tutorial.pdf``` contains the slides from the tutorial session.
